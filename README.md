# Petroleum-Regression-Prediction
The goal of this project is to build a Deep learning model that can accurately predict the price of petroleum. Petroleum is a valuable commodity, and its price is influenced by a variety of factors, including global economic conditions, political events, and supply and demand. By developing a model that can predict petroleum prices, we can help businesses and investors make better decisions about when to buy and sell petroleum.

# Methodology:

We will use a variety of Deep learning techniques to build our model, including:

Linear regression
Decision trees
Random forests
Gradient boosting machines
We will train our model on a dataset of historical petroleum prices and various economic indicators. Once our model is trained, we will evaluate its performance on a held-out test set
